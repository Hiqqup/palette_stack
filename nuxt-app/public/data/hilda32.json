{"name":"Hilda32","slug_name":"hilda32","extra":"","author":"skeddles","description":"This\n is based off the cartoon Hilda, which has some beautiful art, in no \nsmall part due to the colors. I created this by grabbing colors from \nover a dozen screenshots from the show, and picking out the most \nimportant colors. I originally had over 70, but reduced it to a much \nsmaller 32 so it would better reflect the cartoon's simplicity. This is \nintended to be used for daytime scenes, I did not include dusk or night \nscenes, as I felt they wouldn't mix well (they could possibly made as \nseparate palettes). I originally made this in 2020 but wasn't totally \nhappy with it until I posted in with some other unfinished palettes on \ndiscord, and there seemed to be some demand to finish it. So I spend a \nfew hours putting some final touches on it, and am pretty happy with the\n result! I would reccomend looking at some hilda screenshots for ideas \non how to use it.","like_count":192,"comment_count":5,"hashtag":"hilda32","color_count":32,"download_count":2320,"colors":["b0766a","98584c","673536","47272f","27141d","543128","854a37","ac6545","c98459","e49f63","f9c287","ddac81","eccfa8","f9e4ca","ffffff","dedbd2","b3a49f","9d7766","d4b25b","c4974d","a7723f","775939","553e28","3c2e1d","475f5c","54858c","77aba7","f27947","d35b2b","9c392d","c64639","e2654f"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/hilda32-palette-example-by-skeddles-881521.png"],"tags":["cartoon","hilda","desaturated","natural","landscape","nature","yellow","faded","paper"]}
