{"name":"The Fated Eight","slug_name":"the-fated-eight","extra":"","author":"Digi","description":"An\n eight color palette with cold highlights and warm lowlights. The \ndesaturated light hues shift gradually towards murky warm browns, with \nmore prominent shifting the further toward each extreme, making it \nperfect for creating moody, foggy scenes. Don't be fooled by the color \nrelativity - there's more green in the highlights than you'd expect. The\n Fibonacci sequence helped me choose the various amount of shifts in hue\n and luminescence throughout this palette, each being adjusted further \nfor readability and contrast.","like_count":88,"comment_count":1,"hashtag":"fatedeight","color_count":8,"download_count":658,"colors":["4c2a1b","513e30","664a4d","6b5f61","807f7f","94a09e","99b5b3","b0cad9"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/the-fated-eight-palette-example-by-digi-689962.png"],"tags":["cold","fog","brown","teal","moody","brown","hueshift","fibonacci"]}
