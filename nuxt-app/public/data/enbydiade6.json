In comparison with its first version, a red and black \nshade were added, which makes the transition between yellow and purple \nmore smoother. Some existing colors were also modified to make them more\n versatile.","like_count":201,"comment_count":0,"hashtag":"enbydiade6","color_count":6,"download_count":1403,"colors":["231c24","332945","5b3f69","8f596c","c2a47e","cce3e3"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/enbydiade6-palette-example-by-anoobbajuov.png"],"tags":["artist","anubiarts","enbydiade6","yellow","red","purple"]}
