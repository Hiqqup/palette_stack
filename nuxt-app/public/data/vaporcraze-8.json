{"name":"Vaporcraze 8","slug_name":"vaporcraze-8","extra":"","author":"Digi","description":"Inspired\n by the playful colors and designs of the late 90s and vaporwave \nasthetics, this hyper saturated palette is perfect for abstract pieces, \nfonts, and UI designs thanks to the high contrast and attention grabbing\n harmonies. Don't be fooled by the unconventional shifts though - it can\n yield surprisingly pleasing space scenes, skies, and even full \nlandscapes! Deep indigo shifts through playful purples before \nskyrocketing to warmer magenta and orange, then veers crazily into green\n before finally landing on a crisp off white highlight.","like_count":86,"comment_count":1,"hashtag":"vaporcraze","color_count":8,"download_count":662,"colors":["e3ede7","c2daa5","cf9363","bf277e","7b1787","580f8c","370891","161439"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/vaporcraze-8-palette-example-by-digi-763381.png"],"tags":["vaporwave","ui","design","nostalgia","space"]}
