{"name":"CGA Mibend4","slug_name":"cga-mibend4","extra":"","author":"Exidelo","description":"Altered\n version of the CGA mode 5 palette at high intensity (CGA PALETTE 2 \n(HIGH) on here). The colours were modified to all have closer values to \neach other, to have a relationship between the red and white, to have a \nrelationship the between the cyan and black, and to have an overall hue \nshift to red-orange (I call it minium). The name of the palette derives \nfrom Minium, Bend (as in colour/hue bend), and the number of colours in \nit. The aim is to create a palette with similar limitations to the \noriginal, but with more flexibility and natural colour schemes.","like_count":89,"comment_count":2,"hashtag":"cgamibend4","color_count":4,"download_count":743,"colors":["291f23","bd502f","34d1af","f7ecb9"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/cga-mibend4-palette-example-by-exidelo-595099.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/cga-mibend4-palette-example-by-exidelo-936742.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/cga-mibend4-palette-example-by-exidelo-862560.png"],"tags":["cga","mode5","highintensity","mibend4","exidelo","night"]}
