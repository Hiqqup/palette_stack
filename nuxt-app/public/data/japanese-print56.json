A while \nago, I took some of these colors for clothing palettes (in the off \nchance a work of mine had a Japanese/Asian-esque culture). A while later\n I aranged them, used the palette ananlyzer, and then thought to myself \n\"wow, this actually works pretty good as a pixel-art palette.\" Of \ncourse, you can be the judge of that. This palette heavily focuses on \nwarm colors, as you can probably tell. I think that gives it its unique \n\"texture\" so to say.","like_count":79,"comment_count":0,"hashtag":"japaneseprint56","color_count":56,"download_count":1965,"colors":["171412","191f45","1f4788","5a4f74","317589","4d8fac","86aba5","a5ba93","749f8d","6b9362","407a52","006442","203838","52593b","5b8930","7a942e","bda928","ceb579","e8dfae","ffeee5","fce655","ffb61e","e08a1e","bb8141","785e49","4c3d30","2e211b","593a27","824b35","ca6924","ff8936","ffa565","ff7952","ff4e20","ed4236","b14a30","752e23","542d24","672422","7b3b3a","913228","c3272b","f8674f","fa7b62","fcc9b9","ffb3a7","f47983","f2666c","db5a6b","c93756","43242a","6d2b50","763568","755d5b","8d608c","bb7796"],"preview_images":[],"tags":["cultural","traditional","japanese"]}
