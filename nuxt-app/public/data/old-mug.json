{"name":"Old Mug","slug_name":"old-mug","extra":"","author":"eldritchrenaissancecake","description":"\"Old\n mug\" 2-bit palette. Kind of a yellow/brown to blue/navy, giving kind of\n a soft relaxing antique mood - reminiscent of a ceramic mug with \"blue \nrutile\" glaze. Disclaimer that I started with inspiration from the \nexcellent \"Ancient Scroll\" palette by Dr_Succubus. But I modified it a bunch to work for my text adventure game \"The Prairie House\" - mainly since I needed a darker navy and for the colours to separate more clearly (especially for pixel text).","like_count":75,"comment_count":0,"hashtag":"oldmugpalette","color_count":4,"download_count":470,"colors":["f3eece","c0af90","3f5956","252b3a"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/old-mug-palette-example-by-eldritchrenaissancecake-126091.png"],"tags":["oldmug","blue","yellow","2bit","soft","rutile"]}
