{"name":"Sin","slug_name":"sin","extra":"","author":"まるき","description":"noun.\n an immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law.\nLike the definition, this palette can be considered a crime against \ntraditional color theories: the highlights are bright cyan and the \nshadows come from the green and yellow family, with a tint of purple. \nEven the number of colors is cabalistic: Jesus had 12 apostoles, the \nPantheon is composed by 12 Olympian Gods, the Sun god Surya has 12 names\n and the human body has twelve cranial nerves, etc. By using this \npalette, you may be getting closer to a more solid truth, who knows. It \nmay be worth trying, because most things in life can serve as a valid \nexperience, even falling from grace.","like_count":163,"comment_count":3,"hashtag":"sin","color_count":12,"download_count":1122,"colors":["7bdce4","dabe7b","ff8e65","cd7a3f","815934","cd5c5c","883434","551b1b","402715","32122d","202215","0a1c19"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/sin-palette-example-by-5fdb72.png"],"tags":["still life"]}
