{"name":"Yamazaki","slug_name":"yamazaki","extra":"","author":"Gors","description":"This\n palette was sampled and edited from an advertisement for Yamazaki \nBaking Company, a Japanese company that was founded in 9 March, 1948. In\n post-World War II Japan, food supplies were dangerously low and the \nAmerican food aid was Western-centric, supplying them with culturally \nalien foodstuffs like bread. A holdover from this period is the modern \nterm for sliced white bread, 食パン 'shokupan', meaning \"bread for eating\" -\n back then, Japanese people would use it as pencil erasers. In the \nfollowing years, bread started to be incorporated in the Japanese diet, \nwith the local bakeries opening their businesses; the creation of \n'anpan', a sweet roll filled with azuki bean paste, was created to cater\n to the local preferences, and now several bread and pastry products \nexist in Japan. It is also worthy to note that during the post-war era, \nefforts were made to create food that was easy to make and culturally \nappropriate to Asian palates. This saw the creation of ramen stands, or \n'shina-soba' as it was known - noodles in pork broth - that also became \nan iconic element of the Japanese cuisine. This palette brings memories \nof this era, with six warm colors that resemble printing from Japanese \nShowa era - the creamy white matches well with the duotone blue-black \nand red-pink combo, bringing a sense of nostalgia and warmth, while also\n being slightly melancholic, bringing about memories of a war-torn \ncountry trying to rebuild itself from the rubble. While we all know the \neffects of the WWII, small cultural elements like those can give us \nfurther insight on how world-changing this event was.","like_count":73,"comment_count":2,"hashtag":"yamazaki","color_count":6,"download_count":530,"colors":["363a54","8c7e7d","d9c8be","d699a0","c74061","843451"],"preview_images":[],"tags":["yamazaki","retro","showa"]}
