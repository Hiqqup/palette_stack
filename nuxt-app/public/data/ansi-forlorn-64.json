{"name":"ANSI Forlorn 64","slug_name":"ansi-forlorn-64","extra":"","author":"akamos777","description":"This\n palette uses only colors from the old 216 color \"web-safe\" list that \nwas never really used for much in practice. So the only values for the \nr, g, or b components are one of: 0x00, 0x33, 0x66, 0x99, 0xCC, or 0xFF.\n The creation of it came about because I was thinking of making a \nmoodily colored textmode videogame, & that 216 color cube is \ncommonly available in ANSI 256-color text modes.Well, I got my \nresearch mixed up and most textmodes use different hex values for that \ncolor cube (0x00, 0x5f, 0x87, 0xAF, 0xD7, 0xFF are the values often \nused), but I liked it, and I started coloring my game art with these \ncolors. It has a kind of retro vibe, and still looks nice when used in a\n typical 256 color text console (with those alternate hex values).There is a pretty good range for different art styles, and it can get a nice NTSC NES look pretty easily.","like_count":62,"comment_count":1,"hashtag":"ansiforlorn64","color_count":64,"download_count":1115,"colors":["ffffcc","cccc99","999966","666633","333300","666600","999933","cccc66","ffff99","ffff66","cccc33","999900","ccff99","99cc66","669933","336600","003300","336633","669966","99cc99","ccffcc","ccffff","99cccc","669999","336666","003333","000033","333366","666699","9999cc","ffccff","cc99cc","996699","663366","330033","660033","990033","cc3333","ff6633","ff9966","ffcccc","cc9999","996666","663333","996600","cc9933","ffcc66","ffcc99","cc9966","996633","663300","cc9900","ffcc00","ff9900","cc6600","993300","660000","330000","000000","333333","666666","999999","cccccc","ffffff"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/ansi-forlorn-64-palette-example-by-akamos777-456012.png"],"tags":["abandoned","ansi","autumn","desaturated","forlorn","gloomy","old","retro","vintage"]}
