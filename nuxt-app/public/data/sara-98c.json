This time it's \nwhitish-orange skintones, reds, purples and teal, in that order of \nimportance. All three ramps interlock in brightness and join at the dark\n end, the light end is yellowish/cream. I developed the palette in \nGrafX2 with heavy use of DawnBringer's palette analysis tool.","like_count":66,"comment_count":3,"hashtag":"sara98a","color_count":16,"download_count":654,"colors":["f6f2ea","ead2ba","eeae8d","de8165","b6444c","811830","4c041c","140008","280c38","3c1871","69448d","a175b2","91aaca","4c79a5","144469","041455"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/sara-98c-palette-example-by-psiweapon-schuldigun-751944.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/sara-98c-palette-example-by-psiweapon-schuldigun-178023.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/sara-98c-palette-example-by-jude-buffum-860320.png"],"tags":["sara","pc98","grafx2","portrait","dithering","queer","12bit"]}
