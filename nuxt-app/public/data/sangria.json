The \nred reminded me of the sangria my ex used to make. If she's reading \nthis, I miss you. Even though it's been 10 years, you're still in \nthoughts every single day. I think I may have left my Assassin's Creed \ntrilogy box set at your place. When can I pick it up? Sundays are best \nfor me, but let me know and we'll work something out.","like_count":97,"comment_count":8,"hashtag":"sangria","color_count":3,"download_count":800,"colors":["210613","f63090","fffff5"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/sangria-palette-example-by-poltergasm-202120.png"],"tags":["sangria","3colors","minimal"]}
