{"name":"Mac Paint","slug_name":"mac-paint","extra":"","author":"Polyducks","description":"Sampled\n from a genuine Apple Macintosh CRT in 2021, it uses the light blue and \nfaded black to carry 1bit art in the closest you can get to looking at \nan Apple Macintosh screen's colours without sitting in front of one. \nTake note that the colours are sampled from a daylight photograph of \nactual hardware then manually adjusted to best match the image, and is \nthus a representation of how the art displays as opposed to how it's \nrecorded in software (which definitely would've been true black or \nwhite). Anyone has permission to use this palette for any purpose.","like_count":268,"comment_count":3,"hashtag":"macpaintpalette","color_count":2,"download_count":1789,"colors":["8bc8fe","051b2c"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/apple-mac-1bit-crt-palette-example-by-polyducks-60f968.png"],"tags":["1bit","applemac","macintosh","applemac","blue","simple","lowspecification","hardware"]}
