Also, it becomes more saturated as the colors get darker. Pure \nwhite is also included if you really want to make something pop.","like_count":81,"comment_count":2,"hashtag":"survivalhorror32","color_count":32,"download_count":1365,"colors":["cea19d","9e6363","71353f","4f1b30","380e27","c9cb9f","a99a73","805947","623333","471f1f","95bf91","679a73","41745a","20494b","0f2935","96a5bc","6f779e","514a78","402c56","351740","b29cc3","a278ad","8b5084","693054","5a2033","b7c0c7","8c929e","5c6174","403e52","2d2738","ffffff","000000"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/survival-horror-32-palette-example-by-shatteredreality-278849.png"],"tags":["horror","survivalhorror"]}
