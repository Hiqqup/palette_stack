{"name":"HarrisThoth - 12","slug_name":"harristhoth-12","extra":"","author":"Aurel L.","description":"Made\n for Lospec Discord September Study Palette Contest. The artist I \nstudied was Frieda Harris, specifically the tarot she created in \nconbjuct with infamous Alisteir Crowley. I recently came into posession \nof the AGM URANIA copy of he deck which was made from the restored \npaintings she made. Even if this tarot was made by a jerk like Crowley, \nHarris art is worth it - it is enchanting, electric and overwhelming. I \nnamed my palette in her honour, as her name is often lost when \ndiscussing it even if she was the one who pushed Crowley to make it. Her\n paintings, more than his rants make this deck a piece of art for me.","like_count":78,"comment_count":0,"hashtag":"harristhoth12","color_count":12,"download_count":266,"colors":["b6b8ad","bba06b","ae5744","5e1823","8da08d","5e7e4f","0a434c","43717e","8b7395","6b4859","987526","11151e"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/harristhoth-12-palette-example-by-aurel-l-330700.png"],"tags":["desaturated","tarot","septemberstudypalettecontest"]}
