{"name":"ZX Spectrum","slug_name":"zx-spectrum","extra":"","author":"Polyducks","description":"A\n true-to-hardware palette. Please note that the luminesence of the ZX \nSpectrum is dictated by the voltage output of the hardware (85% voltage \nfor non-bright, 100% for bright) - so instead of using E/F values as \ndictated in the wikipedia article in the hex for non-bright/bright, the \ncolours are instead D8/FF (D8 being 85% of FF). For example, non-bright \nred is given as EE0000 in the article - instead it has been portrayed \nhere as D80000 to give as close to hardware output as possible on modern\n screens.","like_count":94,"comment_count":1,"hashtag":"zxspectrum","color_count":15,"download_count":3257,"colors":["000000","0000d8","0000ff","d80000","ff0000","d800d8","ff00ff","00d800","00ff00","00d8d8","00ffff","d8d800","ffff00","d8d8d8","ffffff"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/zx-spectrum-palette-example-by-retro-6197ee.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/zx-spectrum-palette-example-by-helpcomputer0-583998.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/zx-spectrum-palette-example-by-helpcomputer0-744004.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/zx-spectrum-palette-example-by-helpcomputer0-160685.png"],"tags":["zxspectrum","hardware","computing","retro"]}
