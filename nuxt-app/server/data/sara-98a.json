I \ndeveloped it with GrafX2 while making the sampled portrait, so it's \nmeant to be used for warm-ish dithered illustrations. All three ramps \n(pink, skintone, gray-to-brown) interlock and join at the light and dark\n ends, so within their very limited colorspace they should be somewhat \nversatile.","like_count":104,"comment_count":3,"hashtag":"sara98a","color_count":16,"download_count":1116,"colors":["b61030","e24050","ee7175","f69d9d","fffff2","ead6aa","daa56d","ca713c","ae4c30","7d1818","551008","713410","657150","71958d","a5baae","1c0810"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/sara-98a-palette-example-by-psiweapon-schuldigun-128481.png"],"tags":["sara","pc98","grafx2","portrait","warm","interior","dithering","12bit","penitence","nightmare"]}
