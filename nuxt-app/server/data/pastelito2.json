Unlike Nostalgi2 (another palette of \nmine) which was desaturated, this palette goes the opposite way, \nfocusing on pastel colors by having a bright gray and saturated white. \nNow you can truly go for a soft look in your 1-bit art.","like_count":179,"comment_count":4,"hashtag":"pastelito2","color_count":2,"download_count":1622,"colors":["4b475c","d7dedc"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/pastelito2-palette-example-by-anoob3hn7mc.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/pastelito2-palette-example-by-outerspec-585155.png"],"tags":["artist","anubiarts","pastelito2","pastel","1bit","monochrome"]}
