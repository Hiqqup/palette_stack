{"name":"Nostalgi14","slug_name":"nostalgi14","extra":"","author":"Anubi","description":"(Probably)\n my final take on the Nostalgi palette series. 14 desaturated colors \nplaced in 5 (6, if you count a different color a new) different ramps \n(gray, green/blue, red, brown, purple), with many of these colors being \nshared between ramps (most noticeably the dark purple/brown, which is \nshared between all ramps except gray!). Due to this, the connections of \ncolors between ramps was improved in comparison with Nostalgi8, which \nshould allow for smoother transitions between colors. An all-in-one \npalette for desaturated colors.","like_count":73,"comment_count":3,"hashtag":"nostalgi14","color_count":14,"download_count":658,"colors":["261f33","3c3f4f","717882","cccccc","81cc88","77959e","58578c","492d54","a65370","c78e77","855967","663a5e","7b4c7d","b07994"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/nostalgi14-palette-example-by-anoobd0hjnt.png"],"tags":["artist","anubiarts","versatile","desaturated","nostalgi14"]}
