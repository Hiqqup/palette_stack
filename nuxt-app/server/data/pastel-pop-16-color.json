{"name":"Pastel Pop-16 Color","slug_name":"pastel-pop-16-color","extra":"","author":"AxulArt","description":"Although it says \"16 colors\", there are really only 15 colors, since one of those colors is used for transparencies ,\n I wanted to create a color palette that could achieve many harmonious \ncombinations with just a few colors. I guess it would be ideal for \nfantasy consoles (if you don't mind pastel tones) or for retro \naesthetics like the GameBoy Color  .
