{"name":"Asympix18","slug_name":"asympix18","extra":"","author":"Exidelo","description":"Palette\n for Pixeljoint's 18 colour palette competition. This palette takes into\n consideration human vision and is balanced on top of it, making it \n\"human-centric\" as I like to call it. The aim is to make as balanced and\n versatile a palette as possible within the given limitations; with the \nkey balancing feature being the elimination and inclusion of certain \ncolours based on their importance to the human mind. The distribution of\n the colours is skewed in such a way that the red-yellow range of the \nspectrum receives the most attention, followed by blue and green. The \nreasoning behind this is that this colour range in particular is the \nmost important to our mind (most obviously because it accounts for all \nparts of the human skin). The palette's light and dark colours are \ndistributed in such a way that there are more light colours than dark \nones, with the reasoning being that we place more importance on the \nlights rather than on the shadows of an object or scene. In addition, \nthe brightness and darkness of the black and white colours has been \nslightly neutered, to allow for a smoother transitions overall. \nUltimately this should prove to be a balanced and flexible \npalette.","like_count":97,"comment_count":0,"hashtag":"asympix18","color_count":18,"download_count":832,"colors":["ca563e","e8864e","f1ba8e","ecd999","f1f0d9","a5dbd0","94c1ba","4ea9c1","373b42","847b8f","6d423e","8f6540","aa8537","e7b550","a4ad67","649451","3e6b5a","232323"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/asympix18-palette-example-by-exidelo-390593.png"],"tags":["pixeljoint","competition","palettecompetition","misology","asympix","exidelo","night","mythology","humancentric","balanced"]}
