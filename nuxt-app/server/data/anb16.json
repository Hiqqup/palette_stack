{"name":"ANB16","slug_name":"anb16","extra":"","author":"Anubi","description":"Originally\n made as a palette for one of my asset packs, ANB16 contains 6 color \nramps (Gray, Pink, Red, Green, Blue and Brown) distributed along 16 \ndifferent color values, with interchangeable colors along them (such as \nthe orange/yellow colors, which can be used for the brown ramp, or the \ndarkest \"blue\", which can be used in all ramps but brown). Made to be as\n general-use as it can be, while also being restricted by the amount of \ncolors on it. Because it was originally made for one of my asset packs, \nit has a saturated look to it, which should make your art pop-out.","like_count":134,"comment_count":7,"hashtag":"anb16","color_count":16,"download_count":1300,"colors":["0a080d","697594","dfe9f5","f7aaa8","d4689a","782c96","e83562","f2825c","ffc76e","88c44d","3f9e59","373461","4854a8","7199d9","9e5252","4d2536"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/anb16-palette-example-by-anoobrcvmch.png"],"tags":["anb16","anubiarts","16","artist","saturated","bold"]}
