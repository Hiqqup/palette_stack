{"name":"Puffy-Poyo","slug_name":"puffy-poyo","extra":"","author":"Zuhaitz","description":"A\n large palette with a lot of variety, created with the purpose of \ndrawing characters and fanarts. Even though I used it a lot for \ncharacters, it can also be used for props and backgrounds. The palette \nwas originally created to draw my OC Puffy and Kirby, and that's why is \ncalled 'Puffy Poyo'. Fun fact, 'Poyo' also sounds like chicken in \nspanish, so it's kinda funny.","like_count":135,"comment_count":1,"hashtag":"puffypoyo","color_count":27,"download_count":1627,"colors":["302459","4b4980","797eb3","a9b2d9","fffdeb","a3ffb7","63d6bb","4993a6","3a5d8c","48378a","4c64ba","668bf2","73ccff","b3f5f5","ffc7d8","f792d7","d466d4","8e409c","d4577c","ff8785","ffc191","fff1b8","ffdfbf","f2b299","d68181","a65b7a","7d4370"],"preview_images":["https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/puffy-poyo-palette-example-by-zuhaitz-782968.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/puffy-poyo-palette-example-by-zuhaitz-956824.png","https://cdn.lospec.com/palette-examples/puffy-poyo-palette-example-by-unfamiliarghost-996229.png"],"tags":["artist","versatile","desaturated","27","puffy","pixltree","puffypoyo","linear"]}
